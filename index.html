                <div>
                    <p>The antibodies can be diluted in buffers such as PBS or TBS. A detergent such as Tween 20 (0.05% v/v) can be inluded to reduce non-specific binding. We recommend making the working dilution fresh on the day of use. Carrier proteins such as BSA or normal serum are not necessary, and in some cases can increase background staining due to protein-protein interactions</p>

                    <p>For most applications, we recommend blocking with normal serum (5% v/v) from the same species as the host of the secondary antibody. Other commonly used reagents such as BSA and non-fat dry milk are suitable for some applications, but may increase background if the secondary antibody is directed against goat, sheep, or horse.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Immunoglobulin classes (IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, IgM in mammals) are defined by the structure of their heavy chains. Minor differences on heavy chains are found between subclasses of each class. Jackson ImmunoResearch offers polyclonal antibodies that are specific for <a href="#">mouse subclasses IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG2c, and IgG3</a>. We also have antibodies that are specific for <a href="#">camelid subclasses IgG 2+3</a>. We currently do not have subclass-specific antibodies against other species. </p>

The heavy chains may be further differentiated as subclasses, e.g. gamma 1 (IgG1). </p>
                    <p>An isotype control is a negative control that verifies specific binding of either a primary or secondary antibody. The isotype control is the same class or subclass as the experimental antibody, but is not specific for the antigenic target. <a href="#">Isotype controls may be purified IgG from normal serum</a> of the species host of the experimental antibody; or in the case of monoclonal antibodies may be monoclonals of the same subclass, directed against an irrelevant antigen. Isotype controls for unlabeled antibodies are unlabeled, and controls for labeled antibodies are labeled with the same reporter molecule (fluorophore, enzyme, or biotin) as the experimental antibody. </p>
