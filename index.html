                <div>
                    <p>The antibodies can be diluted in buffers such as PBS or TBS. A detergent such as Tween 20 (0.05% v/v) can be inluded to reduce non-specific binding. We recommend making the working dilution fresh on the day of use. Carrier proteins such as BSA or normal serum are not necessary, and in some cases can increase background staining due to protein-protein interactions</p>

                    <p>Immunoglobulin classes (IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, IgM in mammals) are defined by the structure of their heavy chains. Minor differences on heavy chains are found between subclasses of each class.

We also have antibodies that are specific for <a href="#">camelid subclasses IgG 2+3</a>. We currently do not have subclass-specific antibodies against other species. </p>

                    <p>An isotype control is a negative control that verifies specific binding of either a primary or secondary antibody. The isotype control is the same class or subclass as the experimental antibody, but is not specific for the antigenic target. <a href="#">Isotype controls may be purified IgG from normal serum</a> of the species host of the experimental antibody; or in the case of monoclonal antibodies may be monoclonals of the same subclass, directed against an irrelevant antigen. Isotype controls for unlabeled antibodies are unlabeled, and controls for labeled antibodies are labeled with the same reporter molecule (fluorophore, enzyme, or biotin) as the experimental antibody. </p>
